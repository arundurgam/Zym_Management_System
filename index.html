Eating boiled chicken while dieting helps you control your calories.Boiled chicken contains 43 calories per 1 oz. serving. The USDA's standard 3-oz. serving of meat translates to 129 calories.You can add 
   another 1 to 2 oz. of chicken each day, or eat another protein such as seafood, beans or lean beef to meet your requirement.</p>
